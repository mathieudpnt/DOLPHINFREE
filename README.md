## Description
"BBPs", "Clicks" and "Whisltes" folders each treat a type of signal emitted by dolphins.   
- Each folder contains numbered scripts for step-by-step execution. 
- ___Utils.py files contain the functions necessary to the execution of the other scripts
- "Results" and other subfolders contain... results and other outputs (surprise surprise).  

"Stats" folder contains the files used to carry on a statistical analysis of extracted data.   
"CSV_data" folder contains the visual observations made during experiments.  
"Audio_data" folder is empty. Files cannot be made available publicly due to the presence of copyrighted elements.

## Get Started
.py files were developped using Python 3.9.7.  
If needed, you can add missing packages to your environement using: 
```bash
$ pip install name-package
```

.matlab files can be executed in matlab or octave.
